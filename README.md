Acting as a pseudo-index fund, our token leverages [modern portfolio theory](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/investing-101/modern-portfolio-theory) and [Markowitz Optimization](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~burke/crs/408/fin-proj/mark1.pdf) to to both provide agenerate [statistically optimized](/optimizing/balancer.ipynb) low-risk, medium-risk, and high-risk baskets of top 30 cryptocurrencies (by market cap) that can be sold as indepedent, easily accessible diversification instruments for independent investors and funds. 

Built with love during the [Blockgeek Hackathon](http://bglhackathon.com/)
